    "Then I googled `facebook data analyzer github`, so that I can just download a package and do the analysis. As you can see in this [list](https://github.com/topics/facebook-data-analyzer) there is not a lot. \n",

    "There is a nice library written in Ruby with more than 100 commits and 505 stars, but it's more than 2 years old now. The other thing is that I was looking for a solution with which I can mess around (e.g. maybe use the data getters to do some deep learning on my message history) and I didn't really want to get into Ruby (sorry Ruby users).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some python packages, but they offer little-to-no data interfaces. Most of them focus on visualizing the results with plots, and the data getters were desgined around the plotter functions. Although you may want to check out [fviz](https://github.com/itzmeanjan/fviz) which offers really nice plots. Probably nicer then this library would ever have. "
