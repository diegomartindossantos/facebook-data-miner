    "There are also some python packages, but they offer little-to-no data interfaces. Most of them focus on visualizing the results with plots, and the data getters were desgined around the plotter functions. Although you may want to check out [fviz](https://github.com/itzmeanjan/fviz) which offers really nice plots. Probably nicer then this library would ever have. "
